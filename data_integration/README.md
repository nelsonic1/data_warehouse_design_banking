# Data Integration Strategy

There are many potential ways to accomplish this task but one possible approach for integrating data between a NoSQL database like DynamoDB and a relational database like Postgres into a Cloud Data Warehouse is outlined below:

1. **Capture Change Data**: Utilize the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) on both databases to track changes. AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) can be used to capture the Change Data Capture (CDC) data from the WAL. As an alternative, you could skip DMS and write scripts to integrate directly into these databases and write the results to S3.

2. **Data Lake Storage**: Store the captured CDC data into an S3 bucket in your data lake. This raw CDC data will be used as the source for further processing.

3. **Glue Crawler and Data Catalog**: Run AWS Glue Crawlers to scan and catalog the data within the S3 buckets of the data lake. The results will be stored in the Glue Data Catalog for easy access and reference.

4. **CDC Data Deduplication**: Use Glue Spark to process the CDC data and perform deduplication as needed. The deduplicated data will be used to update another S3 bucket that will serve as the staging data. This data will also be crawled by Glue Crawlers.

5. **Data Format and Storage**: Store the staging data in Parquet format, which is efficient for big data processing. More advanced data lake table formats like Hudi, Iceberg, Delta can be considered if the use case arises to perform ACID compliant transactions against a data lake.

6. **Data Ingestion into Snowflake**: Ingest the staged data into Snowflake, a cloud-based data warehouse. Leverage dbt (data build tool) to create data warehouse models using the staged data and organize them into appropriate schemas.

7. **Reporting and Visualization**: Allow data visualization tools such as Looker, Quicksight, or Tableau to access the data warehouse models for reporting and analysis purposes.

8. **Data Querying with Athena**: Since the data lake contains the raw data, use AWS Athena to directly query the data using the Glue Data Catalog for ad-hoc querying and analysis.

9. **Orchestration and Monitoring**: Use Apache Airflow to orchestrate various data integration tasks, such as Glue jobs, Glue crawlers, dbt, and any necessary Python scripts. Monitor the DMS and Glue jobs using AWS CloudWatch. To monitor query times/performance in Snowflake, we can set query tags in dbt and build views inside Snowflake using dbt that queries internal tables and materializes the data out to a table where it can be connected to a data visualization tool for monitoring. Additionally, you can set up resource monitors in Snowflake that will send an email/slack notification when a certain condition is met in case you want to check for long running queries or excess credit consumption.

10. **Machine Learning**: Since we built a data lake with all of the de-duplicated data, we are now set up to build machine learning models on top of our data lake using something like SageMaker.


By following this data integration strategy, you can synchronize data between a NoSQL database and a relational database, store it in a data lake for further processing, and make it available for reporting and analytics using a modern cloud-based data warehousing solution.

Additional note: Depending on the data freshness requirements, you can scale this solution back to pure batch based incremental or you can scale it forward to use a full streaming solution that involves DMS, Kinesis/Kafka, Spark Streaming and/or Lambdas. There are many ways to approach this problem.
